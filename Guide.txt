Machine-Learning basic installation guide (Windows)

#install git @  https://git-scm.com/downloads

#Run all the following code in command prompt

mkdir "Aircraft Project"  
cd Aircraft Project
git clone https://github.com/IamJk28/aircraftgit
xcopy /E Aircraft ..

#now we create a new virtual environment (venv) for all modules (this sections off the modules we need for Machine-Learning from the rest of our computers modules/libraries)

#These lines create and/or load the venv (here we call it odn)
python -m venv odn
odn\Scripts\activate

#These lines setup pip, setup jupyter notebooks and allow us to use our venv as our kernel
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
pip install ipykernel
pip install jupyter notebook
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=odn

#run jupyter notebook (be sure to set "odn" as kernel as that is our venv)
jupyter notebook

#On the Jupyter home page, open Aircraft model.ipynb

#run steps 0-2 of Aircraft model.ipynb

#now run step 2.5 of Aircraft model.ipynb, installing libraries until it runs properly (required libraries could be tensorflow cycler kiwisolver, but it varies)

#run step 3 of Aircraft model.ipynb

#copy images and corresponding labels from our MS teams page to Aircraft Project/Tensorflow/workspace/images/collectedimages

#run step 4,5,6 of Aircraft model.ipynb
